#+title: TODO

* Douban [3/7]
1. [X] project set up
2. [X] parse HTML response
3. [X] crawl douban
4. [ ] deal with utf8
5. [ ] datatype to represent Book History
   #+begin_src haskell
data Book = Book
  { name :: Text
  , author :: Text
  , comment :: Text
  , createdDate :: ??
  , category :: BookCategory
 }
   #+end_src
6. [ ] idempotent for crawl
   + check the total size of book list. if it is same, assume it is done already.
7. [ ] Shall I deal with book images?
   + image is at book detail page, which implies N extra requests hence may hit rate limit.
   + also how to store image?
     - original link, implies bunch of image loading request when display book list eventually
     - blob in DB or local. a bit heavy.
8. [ ] tags
   - this is context for authenticated user unfortunately.
