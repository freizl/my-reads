#+title: TODO

* Douban [7/8]
1. [X] project set up
2. [X] parse HTML response
3. [X] crawl douban
4. [X] deal with utf8
   - BS and Text library already handle it properly
   - It is just ~print~ function that isn't able to produce utf8 to stdout.
5. [X] datatype to represent Book History
   #+begin_src haskell
data Book = Book
  { name :: Text
  , author :: Text
  , comment :: Text
  , createdDate :: ??
  , category :: BookCategory
 }
   #+end_src
6. [X] idempotent for crawl
   + check the total size of book list. if it is same, assume it is done already.
7. [ ] Shall I deal with book images?
   + image is at book detail page, which implies N extra requests hence may hit rate limit.
   + also how to store image?
     - original link, implies bunch of image loading request when display book list eventually
     - blob in DB or local. a bit heavy.
8. [X] tags
   - this is context for authenticated user unfortunately.
